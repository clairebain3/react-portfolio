      <h3><a id ="About_me">About Me</a></h3>
      <p>I am a full stack web developer living and working in Seattle, WA. I grew up in Oregon, and I moved to Massachusetts for college. After college I moved to Boston and worked in Data Services at a law firm, where I learned SQL and developed an interest in coding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to pursue a career in tech, so I moved to Seattle where I'm currently a UW Coding Bootcamp Student </p>
          
       <p>Outside of work, I like painting, psychology, cooking, being outside, and spending time with my cat, Tiger.</p>
